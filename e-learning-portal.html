            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>As Athlon Studio undergoes rapid expansion, a crucial requirement emerged for a centralized learning hub to enhance onboarding and provide continuous learning resources. This rapid 2-week project aimed to create an accessible platform catering to employees' UX design education needs.Â </p>
            <p>This initiative addresses the company's growth demands, accentuating learning efficiency and exemplifying Athlon Studio's commitment to fostering a culture of ongoing personal and team development. The e-learning portal empowers employees to access UX/UI design resources at their convenience, contributing to a dynamic learning environment.</p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>1. Athlon Studio's rapid growth makes it challenging to share knowledge and processes across the company, its employees and various communication channels.</p>
            <p>2. New designers joining the team encounter challenges during onboarding as they are unfamiliar with Athlon Studio's design procedures.</p>
            <p>3. There is a lack of centralized design standards or comprehensive documentation to set clear expectations for design work and skills at Athlon Studio.</p>

          <div class="p-item p-item6">
            <h3>Internal Site Survey</h3>
            <p>One of the key findings from the internal survey was how employees learned about new tools within the organization. The results of this question shed light on a distinct gap between learning through formal onboarding and learning through discussions. While 50% of participants reported relying on company onboarding, a significant 95.5% emphasized the influential role of colleague-driven discussions in discovering new tools. This striking contrast highlights the need for enhanced onboarding efforts to bridge this gap.</p>

            <h3>Design Operations Card-Sorting</h3>
            <p>This initiative emerged as a pivotal research effort driven by one-on-one interviews with numerous employees. This exercise involved sorting lessons and identifying potential categories. </p>
            <p>Some employee feedback received, including quotes such as "mini courses with different modules" and "...I need to know how to do this specific task," highlighted the demand for a centralized learning environment.</p>
