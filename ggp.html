      <div class="p-item page-sp5">
        <h3>Competitor & Comparator Analysis</h3>
        <p>Through an extensive competitor & comparator analysis a diverse range of applications and websites such as Dropbox, Craft, Expedia, and others, we gained valuable insights into document gathering, event planning, and user preferences. By segmenting platforms based on their focus areas, we discerned commonalities in user flow and process. Notably, platforms like Planning Pod provided direct and clear steps, inspiring the aspiration for a comprehensive guideline within our design.</p>
        <p>Our internal-use platform aims to consolidate various functionalities, addressing distinct needs and tasks not currently fulfilled by third-party platforms.</p>
